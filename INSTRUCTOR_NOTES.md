## Delivery Notes  

### General Tips for Delivery  
- **Set the Tone:** Emphasize that AI is a tool to augment their skills, not a replacement for problem-solving or critical thinking.  
- **Encourage Participation:** Use the exercises to foster discussion and collaboration. Encourage students to share their prompts and results in Slack or during class.  
- **Highlight Limitations:** Remind students that AI can generate incorrect or outdated information. Stress the importance of verifying AI-generated code against official documentation and best practices.  
- **Time Management:** Allocate time for each exercise and discussion to ensure the lesson stays on track.

#### 7. **The 15-Minute Rule (10 minutes)**  
- Explain the time-boxing approach to problem-solving.  
- Walk through the workflow: self-investigation, searching online, asking mentors, and finally using AI.  
- Encourage students to reflect on their experiences with the 15-minute rule and share their insights.  

#### 8. **Using AI to Generate Large Data Sets (15 minutes)**  
- Demonstrate how to use AI to generate data sets for projects, such as lists of countries or trivia questions.  
- Guide students through refining the generated data by adding additional properties.  
- Discuss the pros and cons of using AI-generated data vs. API-sourced data.
